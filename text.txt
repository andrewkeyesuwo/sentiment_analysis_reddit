Serious tho, it looks delicious   
Plating done excellent! Looks delicious 
Looks amazing! Id be happy to pay for this in a restaurant!

I like the chorizo, but I would probably be hesitant. Wasn t the chorizo not overpowering the octopus? 
Sounds amazing 
Nice plate

I would probably eat two of those with a glass of orange juice. 
I know what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow. 
I used to eat this for breakfast every day. How did you do the egg? That was always the hard part for me eggs never seem to want to stay at a convenient English-muffin-size diameter. Did you use one of those silicone rubber rings? 
Now i want one 
ARE YOU LOVING IT!?!

Is this one of those "boil it THEN put the seasoning on"??? Because I see dry seasoning on crawfish and that ain't right :/ 

Also I see forks or something being used to open them.....oh the debauchery! 
Why don't they use plates at these things? 
I ve been thinking about boiling shrimp whole. How did it turn out? 
Naw, two 10gal pots with ~20Oz OB in each, some folks wanted more after the fact. As for the forks, those aren t forks, just a style of cracker, and also optional. 
Easier clean up. Garbage is picked out and everything else is composted.

**Japanese style beef curry**

* 900-1.000g stewing beef (chuck works well; it should be a cut with a bit of fat in it and not too sinewy)
* 2 Kg onions
* 6 cloves garlic
* 2 Tbs grated ginger
* 2 400g cans of crushed tomatoes
* 2 beef stock cubes
* 2 bay leaf
* 2 star anise
* 5-6 Tbs. garam masala
* 8 large carrots
* 2 medium eating-type apple, grated
* 8 medium potatoes
* Oil or butter
* Salt and pepper

**For the curry roux:**

* 100g. butter
* 8 Tbs. white flour
* 3-4 Tbs. curry powder, or more to taste

Served with plain white steamed Japanese rice

**Equipment:** A heavy-bottomed 8liter pot. (A thin walled pot leads to burned curry) A sitck blender.

1. Cut beef into cubes about 2 cm / 1 inch square. Brown on medium heat in a little oil on all sides in the heavy-bottomed pot. Add the meat in small batches, don t overcrowd the pot . Remove beefcubes from pot as they are done and set aside.
2. Slice the onions thinly. Grate the ginger and either grate or crush the garlic. Peel and cut the carrots into chunks. Don't peel the potatoes yet: this will come later.
3. Heat your pot over medium heat, and heat up some butter or oil. Add the onions and a teaspoon of salt, and lower the heat to medium-low. Now comes a period of long, slow cooking of the onions that can take up to an hour or so, stir often and scrape the bottom. At the end you want to end up with a much reduced mass of onion that is a light caramel brown in color.
4. Once the onions are reduced, add the ginger and garlic and cook a few more minutes. Add the canned tomato, 1 liter of water, the stock cube and the grated apple
5. Bring up to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 30 min. Dry-roast the garam masala in a small frying pan until it starts to get very fragant, and add to the stew pot. Use a stick blender in the pot until a nice smooth texture is achieved. Add the browned beef cubes, carrots, 1 liter of water (leave room for the potatoes), star anise and bay leaves at this point. Simmer for an additional 30 min.
6. In the meantime, make the curry roux. In a small frying pan, melt the butter and heat until any foaming subsides.
7. Add the flour, and cook the mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it becomes a light brown in color.
8. Take the pan off the heat, and add the curry powder (the more the hotter.) Stir until the whole kitchen and beyond smells like curry. Set aside.
9. When the meat is about as tender as you want, peel the potatoes, cut them into chunks and add to the curry. Continue simmering until the potatoes are tender.
10. Take the pot off the heat and fish out the bay leaf and star anise. Add the roux in small spoonfuls and stir until it's completely melted into the stew and the liquid is thick and very brown. Return to the heat and simmer a few more minutes being careful to not burn the curry. Season with salt (or soy sauce) and pepper to taste.

Enjoy! 
So question, how does this compare to S&B Golden Curry? 
If you do want to go a step further, I recommend replacing half the beef stock with dashi stock. Beef/dashi combo works great and elevates the umami. I like to go crazy and use homemade for both, although homemade dashi is super easy to make with kombu and bonito flakes (instant dashi are also available). 

Another upgrade is that I usually make my own curry paste by blending whole spices. Not necessary, but you can adjust to get a flavor profile you like if you understand the individual spices, which I'm still working on. I basically looked on the back of a Japanese curry powder blend and copied the ingredients, playing with the ratios and seeing what I got. 
Japanese Curry is one of the most underrated dishes in the west. Can never find it in restaurants. 

&nbsp; 

P.S. If you haven't already I highly, highly recommend you try making some Hayashi Rice. Another Japanese beef stew type of recipe that is amazing and under appreciated. 
Eversince persona 5, i ve been craving to make this!  Ty for the recipe!

I need this. 
Followed Kenji s recipe pretty precisely: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/02/detroit-style-pizza-recipe.html

After messing it up a couple times, this attempt at the pizza sauce recipe turned out perfectly and is as fantastic as everyone says. I m lucky enough to live near a Woodman s in Illinois where Brick cheese can be found easily, and it s a revelation in pan pizza making.

One thing I ll try next time: The more typical Detroit approach of leaving the sauce off and then topping the squares with it at the very end. It s delicious to have mixed in, but it also seems to stop the cheese from melting together as well as I d like and the slices then fall apart. 
Please share the recipe.

**Macaron Recipe**

*You really need to weigh these ingredients to get it right. 

100g almond flour

100g powdered sugar

70g room temp egg whites

1/4 tsp cream of tartar

50g white sugar

flavoring and gel coloring as needed (see below)

1. Sift together almond flour with powdered sugar
2. Whisk *room temperature* egg whites until foamy, add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
3. Whisk egg whites on high, slowly adding white sugar until stiff peaks form
4. Sift 1/3 of flour mixture over the egg whites and fold in
5. Sift the rest of the mixture and fold until you can draw a complete figure 8 with the batter that melts into itself after about 10 seconds
6. Line trays with parchment paper or silicone sheets.
7. Fill piping bag with round tip and pipe, holding the bag vertically with the tip about 1cm off the tray. Hold the tip still and pipe for X number of seconds (depending on the width you want)
8. Drop the trays flat on the counter a few times (or more depending on how many neighbors you want to wake up) to get any large air bubbles out.
9. Let sit on counter until tops are not sticky/slightly dry to the touch 
10. Bake at 300F for 18-20 mins for about a 1.5in cookie. I like to make them pretty small and have found 12-15 mins works for a 1in cookie.
11. Let cool on tray for 10mins before removing and cooling completely on cooling rack (a quick process)
12. Fill and sandwich!

*You can add dry flavoring into the flour mixture, food coloring (gel only) to the egg whites, or a concentrated liquid flavoring to the egg whites

** For the peach ones, I divided all the ingredients in half and dyed half the whites orange/red and the other half yellow/orange and mixed the split flour in. I filled the piping bag by taking spoonfuls of each batter and alternating them in the bag. I also took super dry crystallized ginger and powdered it (mortar and pestle) and sifted it into the flour to get a ginger macaron.

***If you have issues, I highly recommend looking up "macaron diagnosis." There are some great resources out there that can likely pinpoint exactly what went wrong. I've used this help many times.


**Buttercream filling**

It's a 3:1 ratio of powdered sugar to butter so I used:

1/2c butter, room temp

1.5 c powdered sugar

1tbsp milk/cream

1/2tsp vanilla extract

1. Whip butter until creamy
2. Whip in powdered sugar slowly
3. Add vanilla
4. Add milk very slowly, you might not even need it all if you plan on adding other liquid ingredients.

*For this recipe, I also made and added super simple peach preserves. I basically cut up a few peaches, added a little lemon, a few slices of ginger, and a small amount of sugar (less than a normal recipe) and boiled them down until it was mush. I mixed this into the buttercream.

**Decorations
I used small mint leaves for the peach leaf. They were attached with a tiny dab of corn syrup. I also added a dab of melted chocolate to the tops as a stem.

***Other flavors: If super sweet macarons aren't your thing (and they really aren't mine) might I suggest an espresso and chocolate combination. Espresso powder in the buttercream and dark cocoa powder in the macarons makes for an amazing combination. 
Do you have the recipe still?? Or where did you find it? 
Perfection 
I don't like any of these flavors but these are SO BEAUTIFUL!

My favorite part of hainanese chicken rice isn't even the chicken or the rice, it's the the ginger-scallion paste

Looks like you have a huge bowl of it 
Ahh, just leaving Singapore atm. Endless cheap chicken rice I will miss you! Looks good!

How do you make the ginger scallion paste? Is that the oil your talking about? That looks amazing.

What s the deal with mushy peas? I watch a lot of British television and they come up a lot. It s just salty peas cooked until they fall apart? 
I would try it 
Aaaah. Do you dip the fish in them?? 
Its a different bean from the garden pea, something called "pease". And it tastes great with a little mint sauce. 
They re marrowfat peas but essentially yes, they re used as a dip/accompaniment. Normal peas wouldn t get the same texture.

This is what I imagine the back of the Lochness monster looks like 
  
**Dough**  
250 g AP flour  
125 g butter (salted)  
cold water  
oregano

Rub butter into flour and oregano, add 6-7 tablespoons of cold water until you have a quick dough. Chill for 20 minutes.

**Filling**  
1 large sweet potato, cut into 1 cm cubes  
1 large carrot, finely diced  
1/2 large onion, finely diced  
1 stalk of broccoli, finely diced (or celery or whatever you have)  
80 g of pork, beef, or vegetarian mince (I used oat)  
1 tsp salt  
1 tsp each of garlic powder, garam masala, mixed herbs, paprika, black pepper

Divide and roll out dough, add filling, crimp shut and brush with egg. Bake for 10 minutes at 220 C, then lower temp to 180 C and bake for another 45.

What sauce did you use? 
Not OP, but it looks like they just watered down some Frank s... 
That s not really how wing sauce works. You d glad it with butter. Texas Pete is thinner than franks too so it could be that. Neither of those being spicy though so that s why I asked. 
I know. You can actually see wings I ve done in my post history. My point is that whatever sauce it is seems light and kind of insubstantial, whatever it is. I prefer something that coats better and has decent heat and flavor. Maybe this sauce is better than it appears, though. They do look pretty crispy, though.
